"Preface  This Standard was prepared by the Joint Standards Australia/Standards New Zealand Committee OB/3, General Conditions of Contract.  This Standard incorporates Amendment 1 (August 1999), Amendment 2 (October 2000), and Amendment 3 (March 2005). The changes required by the Amendments are indicated in the text by a marginal bar and amendment number against the clause, note, table, figure, or part thereof affected.  This Standard is the result of a consensus among Australian and New Zealand representatives on the Joint Committee to produce it as an Australian Standard.  Subclauses 8.6 and 29.2 (prefixed by an asterisk) are optional, and may be omitted in the Contract, where necessary, without making consequential amendments but such omission should be clearly shown on the face of the document by striking out these subclauses or indicating clearly in clause 1 of Annexure Part B or elsewhere that they are not to apply. See paragraph (i) of clause 1 on page 5 for the effect of stating deletions in Annexure Part B.  Warning  Users of this Australian Standard are warned that clause 15 (Damage to persons and property other than work under the Contract (‘WUC’)) does not limit the liability of parties for special, indirect or consequential losses.

Parties wishing to limit their liability should seek insurance and legal advice before entering a contract under this Standard.  Legislation has come into force in some jurisdictions dealing with security of payments. Parties intending to use this Standard should seek expert advice as to their rights and obligations under such legislation.  ",Exhibits

If the moneys payable to the Contractor are insufficient to discharge the liability of the Contractor to pay such sum to the Principal, the Principal may have recourse to retention moneys (whether or not these are held by the Principal in alternative form pursuant to this clause). Nothing in this clause will affect the right of the Principal to recover from the Contractor the whole of such moneys or any balance that remains owing.  26.12  The Superintendent will issue to the Contractor and to the Principal a final payment certificate endorsed ‘Final Certificate’ or a statement of reasons for not issuing the Final Certificate:  (a)  within 10 business days after receiving the payment claim under clause 26.1(d); or  (b)  if the Contractor has not submitted a payment claim under clause 26.1(d), within 30 business days after the expiration of the Defects Liability Period.  26.13  In the final payment certificate, the Superintendent must certify the amount which in the Superintendent’s opinion is finally due from the Principal to the Contractor or from the Contractor to the Principal under, or arising out of, the Contract or any alleged breach thereof, including the release to the Contractor of any retention moneys or security then held by the Principal.  27.

"SCHEDULE 3 – Training Policy  (Clause 7)  Privacy Statement – Queensland Government Building and Construction Training Policy  This privacy statement is to be provided to each participant on an eligible Queensland Government funded building project to comply with the Information Privacy Act 2009 (Qld).  The Queensland Government Building and Construction Training Policy (the Training Policy) requires that a minimum of 10 per cent of the total labour hours on eligible Queensland Government building projects be undertaken by apprentices and/or trainees and through other workforce training.  Compliance and reporting requirements under the Training Policy are conditions of contract for contractors and compliance is measured using data recorded in the Training Policy Administration System (TPAS). This information will ultimately be considered in any review of contractors’ eligibility to tender for future government work.  The Queensland Government requires that contracted organisations collect personal information from participants including:    Apprentice or Trainee   Registration ID  Name  Engaged as Apprentice or Trainee  Employer  Indigenous status  Total hours   Cadet  Undergraduate  Employee  Student  Indigenous Employee   First & surname name  Engaged as Cadet/Undergraduate/ Tradesperson/ Non-Tradesperson/ Prevocational  Student (SWL)  Indigenous status  Total Hours  Contracted organisations must report this information to the Queensland Government in TPAS. The Department of Employment, Small Business and Training (DESBT) administers contractor compliance data through TPAS on behalf of the Queensland Government.  In addition to any contractual provisions, performance reports regarding a contractor’s compliance with the policy will be provided by DESBT to the Director-General or Chief Executive Officer of each Queensland Government agency or Government Owned Corporation as required.  Records collected will be treated as a public record and will be retained as required by the Public Records Act 2002 (Qld). For the term that the record is maintained, the Queensland Government will only use this information to administer the Training Policy and report on contractor compliance.

"Preface  The GC21 (Edition 2) General Conditions of Contract  The GC21 (Edition 2) General Conditions of Contract is the major component of the GC21 Standard Form documents, which also includes the Conditions of Tendering, Tender Schedules and Preliminaries.  The GC21 suite of documents provides a holistic approach to construction procurement, in line with the NSW Government’s 10 point Action Plan. In particular the documents have been designed to:  Standardised Contract  •  provide an easily understood standardised form of contract for building and civil construction over $1m in value, incorporating explanations of key requirements and terms as well as in-built documenter guidance;  •  suit a broad range of design from a minimal concept design to full design. Thus accommodating fully documented; construct only; design and construct; design, development and construct; design, construct & maintain, and other similar types of contract without amendment,  •  incorporate Lump Sum and Schedule of Rates forms of pricing as well as the pricing of options and alternatives;  •  be readily adapted to Managing Contractor, Alliance Agreements, Cost Plus, Target Cost and Guaranteed Maximum Price procurement arrangements;  Collaboration and cooperation  •  continue the highly effective emphasis on co-operative contracting and enhanced communication, including early warning procedures, joint workshops and regular joint evaluation and monitoring;  •  provide equitable risk sharing between the parties, streamline operational processes such as delay and overhead cost assessments and include mechanisms for early agreement on changes and for the use of independent valuers; and  •  incorporate NSW Government initiatives including requirements to improve skills and training, fair dealing with employees and subcontractors as well as Aboriginal Participation and industry diversity.  The GC21 (Edition 2) General Conditions of Contract built on the experience and project success delivered with Edition 1. Edition 2 focused on streamlining, updating and improving the operation of the contract to reflect experience and practice. The requirement for contractors to use the GC21 subcontract was discontinued in Edition 2 and replaced with a short list of mandatory requirements to give the contractor and subcontractors flexibility in their commercial arrangements.

"Contract framework  This section deals with the purpose and structure of the Contract. It allocates responsibilities and sets up the procedures for making the Contract work. Underlying it are the basic principles of GC21: co-operative contracting, enhanced communication, clear definition of roles, responsibility for outcomes, and promoting best practice.  Roles and relationships  Although the parties have different responsibilities, co-operation is a key element of the Contract.  1 General responsibilities  .1  The Contractor must:  .1  design and construct the Works in accordance with the Contract; and  The Contract recognises that the Contractor will always have some design responsibility, irrespective of how the Contract is described. The Contract form has thus been developed to deal with a broad range of design from a minimal concept design to full design. It can suit fully documented; construct only; design, development and construct; design and construct; lump sum or some other similar description of contract. The extent of the Contractor’s Design obligations is specified in clause 39.  .2  perform and observe all its other obligations under the Contract.  .2  The Principal must:  .1  pay the Contractor the Contract Price for its performance, in accordance with and subject to the Contract; and  .2  perform and observe all its other obligations under the Contract.  .3  The Principal may give instructions to the Contractor concerning the Works and anything connected with the Works, and the Contractor must comply at its own cost unless the Contract expressly provides otherwise.  2 Authorised persons  Contractor’s Authorised Person  .1  The Contractor must ensure that, at all times, there is a person appointed to act as the Contractor’s Authorised Person. The Contractor’s Authorised Person acts with the Contractor’s full authority in all matters relating to the Contract. The Contractor must promptly notify the Principal of the name and contact details of the Contractor’s Authorised Person and of any change in those details. If the Principal reasonably objects to the Contractor’s Authorised Person at any time, the Contractor must replace that person.  Principal’s Authorised Person  .2  The Principal must ensure that, at all times, there is a person appointed to act as the Principal’s Authorised Person. The Principal must promptly notify the Contractor of the name and contact details of the Principal’s Authorised Person and of any change in those details.  .3  The Principal’s Authorised Person does not act as an independent certifier, assessor or Valuer. The Principal’s Authorised Person acts only as an agent of the Principal.  .4  The Principal’s Authorised Person may delegate any of its contractual functions and powers to others by written notice to the Contractor.  3 Co-operation  .1  The parties must do all they reasonably can to co-operate in all matters relating to the Contract, but their rights and responsibilities under the Contract (or otherwise) remain unchanged unless the parties agree in writing to change them. ",Terms of Contract
".2  The Contractor must provide the Principal with all information reasonably requested by the Principal to:  .1  monitor the Contractor's compliance with the requirements of the Contract; and  .2  assist the Principal in complying with the NSW Government Policy and Guidelines (including its obligations pursuant to the NSW Procurement Board Direction PBD 2013-01C Financial Assessments).  4 Duty not to hinder performance  .1  Each party must do all it reasonably can to avoid hindering the performance of the other under the Contract.  5 Early warning  .1  Each party must promptly inform the other if it becomes aware of anything that is likely to affect the time for Completion, or the cost or quality of the Works. The parties must then investigate how to avoid or minimise any adverse effect on the Works and Scheduled Progress.  The ‘early warning’ obligation does not replace or relieve the parties of complying with the notification requirements in the Contract. Refer, in particular, to notifications by the Contractor under clauses 37, 38, 45, 48, 49 & 50.  .2  Information provided by a party under clause 5.1 must not be used against that party in any Claim or Issue resolution proceedings.  6 Evaluation and monitoring  As the Contract proceeds, regular meetings (usually monthly) allow the parties and selected stakeholders to evaluate performance and identify priorities for improvement.  .1  The parties must meet regularly to evaluate and monitor performance of the Contract.  Performance Evaluation and Performance Evaluation Record forms are provided at Attachments 2, 2A, 2B and 3. They do not form part of the Contract and the parties may amend them to suit the specific attributes of the Contract.  .2  The parties must decide jointly who will participate in the meetings. Participants may include Subcontractors, Suppliers, Consultants and, if appropriate, representatives of government authorities, end users and local communities. Participation in meetings does not give the participants any additional rights or responsibilities.  .3  Nothing concerning or in connection with completed evaluation forms changes either party’s rights and responsibilities, or can be relied on or used by one party against another in any proceedings.  .4  Participants in the evaluation and monitoring meetings must meet their own costs for attendance, and the parties must share equally the other costs.  The Contract  7 The Contract  The Contract is formed by the execution of the Formal Instrument of Agreement.  .1  The Contract constitutes the entire agreement and understanding between the parties and will take effect according to its terms, despite any understandings, representations and communications made between the parties before the Date of Contract in relation to the subject matter of the Contract. The Contract Documents are:  .1  these GC21 General Conditions of Contract;  .1A the Formal Instrument of Agreement;  .2  the Contract Information;  .3  the annexed Schedules;  .4  the Principal’s Documents; and  .5  the other Contract Documents listed in Contract Information item 26.

".2  an increase in the Contract Price to be valued in accordance with clause 47 for any unavoidable costs incurred by the Contractor additional to what it would have incurred if the Principal had not given the instruction.  .9  If the need for the instruction given under clause 8.8 arises from the Contractor’s own act or omission, the Contractor is not entitled to any extension of time or adjustment to the Contract Price.  9 Assignment  .1  The Contractor must not assign a right or benefit under the Contract without first obtaining the Principal’s written consent.  10 Governing law of the Contract  .1  The Contract is governed by the laws of New South Wales, and the parties submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of New South Wales.  11 Notices and instructions  .1  Notices must be sent to the relevant persons at the addresses in Contract Information items 4 to 11 or 52, or at the address for service most recently notified in writing by the addressee.  .2  All notices must be in writing, and all instructions by the Principal must be in writing or, if given orally, must be confirmed in writing as soon as practicable and, in any event, within 3 Business Days of being given.

The survey must be carried out by a registered surveyor or other surveyor to whom the Principal has no objection.  43 Construction  .1  The Contractor must supply all Materials and construct the Works in accordance with all of the following:  .1  the Contract;  .2  the Contractor’s Documents;  .3  Statutory Requirements;  .4  the Principal’s instructions;  .5  the National Construction Code (if stated in Contract Information item 38B) and relevant Australian Standards; and  .6  if no other standard is specified in the Contract, good industry standards applicable to the Works.  44 Testing  .1  The Contractor must Test all parts of the Works that are specified in the Contract to be Tested, give the Principal the opportunity to witness the Tests by giving reasonable notice, and make the results available to the Principal.  .2  The Principal may instruct the Contractor at any time to carry out any other Test of any part of the Works.  .3  If the results of any Test instructed by the Principal under clause 44.2 show compliance with the Contract, the Contractor may only make a Claim, that complies with clause 68.3, for an increase in the Contract Price to be valued in accordance with clause 47 for any unavoidable additional costs incurred by the Contractor in carrying out the Test. Otherwise the Contractor bears the cost, including any costs of opening up and reinstating any part covered up.  .4  The Contractor must make good any part of the Works where Testing has not shown compliance with the Contract and must repeat the Testing, at its own cost, until the results of the Tests, as reported in writing to the Principal, confirm that the Works comply with the Contract.  45 Defects  The Principal considers the Contractor to be an expert in the design and construction of the Works and holds the Contractor responsible for its work. The Principal requires Completion to be defect-free.  These Defects provisions are to ensure that the Works are constructed to the standards required by the Principal. The Principal can also rely on its common law rights.  Also refer to clause 67 which deals with Defects after Completion. ",Terms of Contract
".1  The Contractor must identify and promptly make good all Defects so that the Works comply with the Contract.  .2  At any time before Completion, the Principal may instruct the Contractor to make good Defects within the time specified in a Defect Notice, as determined by the Principal or the Principal's Authorised Person acting reasonably.  A similar provision applies after Completion under clause 67.1.  .3  If the Contractor fails to make good the Defects in the time specified in the Defect Notice, the Principal may have the Defects made good by others and then:  .1  the cost of doing so will be a debt due from the Contractor to the Principal; and  .2  the Contractor will be responsible for the work involved in making good the Defects as if the Contractor had carried out the work.  .4  Nothing in clause 45 reduces the Contractor’s warranties and other liabilities and obligations under the Contract, or affects the Principal’s common law right to damages or any other right or remedy.  .5  If at any time before Completion the Contractor becomes aware of any Defect or deficiency which results from design or other work or actions for which it is not responsible, it must:  .1  promptly notify the Principal; and  .2  carry out any Variation instructed by the Principal to make good the Defect or deficiency.  46 Acceptance with Defects not made good  .1  The Principal, in its absolute discretion, may agree that specific Defects need not be made good.  .2  Before the Principal does so, the Principal may propose deductions from the Contract Price and any terms it requires.  .3  If the Contractor agrees with the proposed deductions and terms, the Contract Price must be adjusted as agreed.  .4  If the Contractor agrees with the proposed terms but not with the proposed deductions:  .1  if no Valuer is engaged at the relevant time, the parties may agree to engage a Valuer for the purpose of making this single valuation;  .2  if a Valuer is engaged, the Principal may request the Valuer to determine the value of the deductions in accordance with clause 47.7, taking into account any increased future costs, loss of income or reduction in asset life, and the Contract Price will be adjusted accordingly; or  .3  if no Valuer is engaged and the parties do not agree to engage a Valuer then the Principal is to assess the value of the adjustment in accordance with clause 47.7, and advise the Contractor in writing. The Contractor may dispute the assessment of the Principal in accordance with clause 69.  .5  If the parties do not agree in writing on the Principal’s proposed terms, the Contractor must make good the specified Defects.  .6  The Contractor remains liable for all Defects (whether known or not known) other than the specific Defects identified in a written agreement made under clause 46 as not to be made good.  Changes to work and time  47 Valuation of changes  .1  If the Contractor submits a Claim complying with clause 68.3 and the Principal agrees that the Contractor is entitled to an adjustment to the Contract Price or Contractual Completion Date(s), then the parties must endeavour to reach agreement on the adjustments. If agreement cannot be reached then:  .1  if a Valuer is engaged, either party may by giving notice to the other party and to the Valuer, request the Valuer to determine the adjustment; ",Terms of Contract
".2  if no Valuer is engaged at the relevant time, the parties may agree to engage a Valuer for the purpose of making this single valuation; or  .3  if no Valuer is engaged and the parties do not agree to engage a Valuer then, within 28 days after the Contractor has provided the information specified in clause 68.3, the Principal is to assess the value of the adjustments in accordance with clause 47 and clause 50 and advise the Contractor in writing. The Contractor may dispute the assessment under clause 69.  .2  The Principal is not required to assess a Claim nor is a Claim to be referred to the Valuer until the Contractor provides all the information specified in clause 68.3.  .3  If an event entitles the Contractor to adjustments to both the Contract Price and any Contractual Completion Date, these adjustments are to be dealt with together.  .4  If the Principal does not agree that any entitlement exists, the Principal must advise the Contractor in writing and clauses 69 to 71 apply.  Valuation principles  .5  When the Contract requires an adjustment to the Contract Price to be valued in accordance with clause 47, the principles set out below apply.  .6  Subject to clauses 47.8, if the Contractor is entitled to an increase in the Contract Price for additional work or for unavoidable additional costs, the value of the increase is to be assessed or determined by the Principal by reference to the rates in the Schedule of Rates, to the extent that it is reasonable to use those rates, or the sum of:  .1  the additional reasonable direct cost to the Contractor including labour, Materials and plant (not including the Contractor’s Margin);  .2  the additional reasonable costs to the Contractor of Subcontractor and Consultant work involved in carrying out the additional work or in responding to the unavoidable circumstances (not including the Contractor’s Margin);  .3  an additional amount for the Contractor’s Margin, calculated as the percentage stated in Contract Information item 44 of the total of the costs under clauses 47.6.2.1 and 47.6.2.2; and  .4  any delay costs due under clause 51, subject to the requirements of clause 50.  The Contractor is entitled to claim unavoidable additional costs under clauses 8.8, 37.6, 38.3, 49.4, 52.4 and 53.3 when the conditions of those clauses are satisfied.  .7  The value of decreased or omitted work or of any reduction in costs under clause 38, is to be assessed or determined on the basis of rates and lump sums in the Schedule of Rates to the extent that it is reasonable to use those rates or, if there are no applicable rates or lump sums in the Contract, based on reasonable rates and prices applying at the Date of Contract. The deduction must include a reasonable amount for any time-dependent costs which will not be incurred by the Contractor and any profit on the decreased or omitted work.  .8  A valuation under clause 47.6 must not include:  .1  any costs, losses or expenses attributable to any default, negligence or failure to minimise additional costs of the Contractor, Subcontractors or Consultants;  .2  any amount for costs that the Contractor would have incurred anyway or should reasonably have allowed for at the Date of Contract; or  .3  any amount that the Contractor is not entitled to claim under clause 37.8, 38.4, 49.6 or 68.2.  .9  A valuation under clause 46 must take into account the specific matters required by that clause.  Application of adjustments  .10  The Contract Price and any relevant Contractual Completion Date(s) must be adjusted as agreed, assessed or determined under clause 47.  48 Variations  The Principal will normally obtain, and seek to settle by negotiation, the Contractor’s price and allowance for effect on time for a proposed Variation before instructing the Variation ",Terms of Contract
"in writing, and clauses 48.2 to 48.3 provide for this. This does not prevent the Principal from instructing a Variation at any time, subject to clause 48.1, and clause 48.4 provides for this.  Instructing and commencing Variations  .1  The Principal may instruct the Contractor to carry out a Variation by a written document titled ""Variation Order"" at any time before Completion of the whole of the Works (and after Completion in accordance with clause 67.1.3) and the Contractor must comply.  .2  If requested in writing by the Principal, the Contractor must, within the time specified in the request, advise the Principal of the effects of the proposed Variation on:  .1  achieving Completion;  .2  the Contract Price, to be provided as:  .1  the price of the proposed Variation (calculated by reference to the rates in the Schedule of Rates, to the extent that it is reasonable to use those rates, and excluding all costs of delay or disruption), plus,  .2  delay costs as per clause 51 for the number of days by which the time for achieving Completion, as advised in clause 48.2.1, is affected; and  .3  any other matter specified by the Principal.  .3  If the parties have agreed in writing on the effects of a proposed Variation (including all of the matters described in clause 48.2), and the Principal instructs the Contractor to carry out the Variation, any affected Contractual Completion Dates and the Contract Price must be adjusted as agreed.  .4  If the parties have not agreed in writing on the effects of a proposed Variation or the Principal has not made a request under clause 48.2, the Principal may (without being under any obligation to do so):  .1  instruct the Contractor to carry out the Variation, in which case:  .1  the Contractor may make a Claim, that complies with clause 68.3, for:  .1  an extension of time in accordance with clause 50 and delay costs under clause 51, or the Principal may assess a reduction in time in accordance with clause 50; and  .2  an adjustment to the Contract Price to be valued in accordance with clause 47, or the Principal may assess a deduction from the Contract Price to be valued in accordance with clause 47; or  .2  the Principal may assess a reduction in time in accordance with clause 50 or the Principal may assess a deduction from the Contract Price to be valued in accordance with clause 47; or  .2  alternatively, instruct the Contractor to carry out any additional work as Daywork, in which case the requirements of Schedule 8 (Daywork) apply.  .4A If the Variation the subject of an instruction by the Principal under clause 48.1 is for the omission or reduction of any part of the Works:  .1  the Principal may either perform itself, or employ or engage another person or persons to carry out and complete the omitted or reduced work; and  .2  the Contractor will not be entitled to make, nor will the Principal be liable upon, any Claim arising out of or in connection with any work being omitted or reduced from the Works.  Variations proposed by the Contractor  .5  The Contractor may make a written proposal for a Variation for the Contractor’s convenience.  .6  The Principal may accept the Contractor’s proposal but is not obliged to do so. The Principal’s acceptance may be subject to conditions, including that the Variation is at the Contractor’s risk. If the Principal accepts the Contractor’s proposal, the Principal must instruct a Variation, stating any conditions, and make any agreed adjustments to the affected Contractual Completion Dates and the Contract Price.  A Variation accepted under clause 48.6 without conditions increases the risk to the Principal of additional Claims. ",Terms of Contract
".7  If the Contractor considers that a Variation is necessary but the Principal has not instructed a Variation, the Contractor must notify the Principal within 7 days after the Contractor should reasonably have known that a Variation was necessary.  .8  If the Principal does not agree that a Variation is necessary, all issues relating to the claimed Variation must be dealt with under clauses 68 to 71.  .9  The Contractor acknowledges that development of the design by the Contractor does not constitute a Variation.  49 Changes to Statutory Requirements  .1  If the Contractor becomes aware of changes in Statutory Requirements that require a change to the Works (not including changes that the Contractor should reasonably have expected at the Date of Contract), the Contractor must notify the Principal in writing as soon as possible and in any event within 7 days after becoming aware of the changes in Statutory Requirements. The notification must include details of:  .1  the changes to Statutory Requirements;  .2  why the changes to Statutory Requirements should not reasonably have been expected by the Contractor at the Date of Contract;  .3  the changes to the Works that the Contractor considers necessary;  .4  any delays in achieving Completion;  .5  any additional work and resources involved and the Contractor’s estimate of its entitlement to any adjustment to the Contract Price; and  .6  any other matters the Contractor considers relevant.  .2  The Principal may request the Contractor to provide further information about the matters notified under clause 49.1.  .3  After considering the Contractor’s notification under clause 49.1, the Principal must notify the Contractor whether it agrees with the Contractor’s contentions under clause 49.1.1 and 49.1.2 as to the change in Statutory Requirements and whether or not the Contractor should reasonably have expected them.  .4  If the Principal agrees that there are changes in Statutory Requirements that require changes to the Works (that the Contractor should not reasonably have expected at the Date of Contract) and if the Contractor has given the notice required by clause 49.1 then:  .1  the parties may agree in writing on the effects of the change in Statutory Requirements (including any Variation instructed by the Principal), and any affected Contractual Completion Dates and the Contract Price must be adjusted as agreed; and  .2  if the parties have not agreed in writing as to the effects of the unexpected change in Statutory Requirements:  .1  the Principal may instruct a Variation, in connection with the change in Statutory Requirements and to the extent not recoverable under clause 48 as a result of the Variation, the Contractor may also make a Claim, that complies with clause 68.3, for:  .1  an extension of time in accordance with clause 50 and delay costs under clause 51, for any delay incurred by it as a result of the unexpected change in Statutory Requirements that has not been taken into account in any extension of time granted as a result of the Variation; and  .2  an increase in the Contract Price to be valued in accordance with clause 47 for unavoidable additional costs incurred by the Contractor as a result of the unexpected change in Statutory Requirements, but excluding any additional or increased work included in the Variation; or  .2  if no Variation in connection with the change in Statutory Requirements is instructed, the Contractor may make a Claim, that complies with clause 68.3, for:  .1  an extension of time in accordance with clause 50 and delay costs under clause 51, subject to the requirements of those clauses; and ",Terms of Contract
".2  an increase in the Contract Price to be valued in accordance with clause 47 for any unavoidable additional costs incurred by the Contractor because of the unexpected change in Statutory Requirements.  .5  If the Principal does not agree with the Contractor’s contentions under clauses 49.1.1 and 49.1.2, the Contractor may notify an Issue under clause 69.  .6  Costs and delay incurred by the Contractor as a result of changes in Statutory Requirements before it gave the notice required by clause 49.1 must not be counted in any valuation or extension of time.  50 Changes to Contractual Completion Dates  The Contractor is responsible for managing progress to achieve Contractual Completion Dates for Milestones (if any) and for the Works.  The initial Contractual Completion Dates are stated in the Contract Information and these may be adjusted under the Contract.  Clause 50 sets out the conditions under which the Contractor may claim an extension of time for a delay event. It also entitles the Principal to extend time for any reason, at its sole discretion.  Extensions of time  .1  The Contractor is entitled to an extension of time for Completion and an adjustment to the related Contractual Completion Dates if:  .1  the Contractor is or will be delayed in achieving Completion by:  .1  an act, default or omission of the Principal, excluding any act, default or omission:  .1  that is authorised or permitted by the Contract; or  .2  which arises as part of the proper exercise of rights of the Principal under the Contract; or  .2  a qualifying cause of delay, but not including any cause which the Contract expressly states is at the Contractor’s risk or for which the Contract expressly precludes an entitlement for extension of time or for which the delay was caused or contributed to by the Contractor;  .2  the delay is to an activity or activities on the critical path of the then current Contract Program and work is proceeding in accordance with this program;  .3  the Contractor has given the Principal an initial notice in writing within 7 days after the start of the delay which:  .1  sets out the cause of the delay and the steps taken or to be taken to minimise the delay;  .2  sets out any relevant facts; and  .3  includes a copy of the Contract Program, verified as current at the start of the delay which demonstrates how the delay affects the critical path and shows the expected effects of the delay; and  .4  the Contractor has given the Principal the Claim and other information required by clauses 50.3 and 50.4.  Refer to clause 22 for Contract Program requirements  .2  The Contractor must take all reasonable steps to avoid delay and its effects.  .3  If the Contractor is delayed, it may make a Claim, that complies with clause 68.3, for an extension of time in accordance with clause 50. The Claim must:  .1  identify the cause of delay and the extension of time claimed and include other information sufficient for the Principal to assess the Claim; and  .2  be submitted within 28 days after the start of the delay; and  .3  be updated every subsequent 28 days while the delay continues.  .4  With every Claim made under clause 50.3 the Contractor must submit a copy of the then current Contract Program which shows the effects of the delay on the critical path and to the time required to achieve Completion. ",Terms of Contract
".5  The Contractor is only entitled to an extension of time for delays occurring on days on which the Contractor carries out work for the Contract as specified in Contract Information item 18.  .6  When concurrent events cause a delay in achieving Completion and one or more of the events is within the control of the Contractor, then to the extent that the events are concurrent, the Contractor will not be entitled to an extension of time for Completion notwithstanding that another cause of the delay is such that the Contractor would have had an entitlement to an extension of time.  .7  The Contractor is not entitled to an extension of time for any days which are expressly not to be counted under clause 37.8 or 49.6.  .8  The Principal may, in its absolute discretion but without any obligation to do so, extend any Contractual Completion Date at any time and for any reason, whether or not the Contractor has claimed an extension of time. The Principal is not required to exercise the Principal's discretion under this clause 50.8 for the benefit of the Contractor.  .9  If the initial notice, complying with clause 50.1.3, is given to the Principal later than 7 days after the start of the delay, then the Contractor’s entitlement to an extension of time is reduced by one day for each day the notice is provided late.  Reductions in time  .10  If a Variation or resolution of a Fault under clause 38 leads to less time being required for Completion, the Principal may assess a reasonable adjustment to the affected Contractual Completion Date.  Adjustment to Contractual Completion Dates  .11  The relevant Contractual Completion Dates must be adjusted in accordance with clause 47 to account for any extension or reduction of time assessed under clause 50.  Inclement Weather  .12  The parties acknowledge and agree that:  .1  the Contract Program has an allowance for [#insert] days of Inclement Weather (""Inclement Weather Allowance"").  .2  the Principal has a legitimate interest in monitoring and approving the Contractor's use of the Inclement Weather Allowance.  .13  If, and each time that, the Contractor encounters Inclement Weather that prevents the Contractor from performing the Works at the Site, the Contractor must immediately notify the Principal, by email or phone, that it has encountered Inclement Weather.  .14  Within 5 Business Days following each Inclement Weather event, the Contractor must provide a written notice to the Princupal, setting out in detail:  .1  the number of days that it encountered Inclement Weather;  .2  the dates on which it encountered Inclement Weather; and  .3  details of the Inclement Weather encountered,  that prevented the Contractor from performing the Works at the Site.  .15  The Principal shall, within 5 Business Days following the receipt of the written notice from the Contractor, notify the Contractor if it agrees that the Site has been affected by Inclement Weather and may request additional information from the Contractor in relation to the Inclement Weather event.  .16  Within 7 days of the date on which the Contractor forms the opinion that it has exhausted the Inclement Weather Allowance in the Contract Program, the Contractor must provide the Principal with a written notice of that fact and setting out in detail:  .1  the dates on which it encountered Inclement Weather; and  .2  details of the Inclement Weather encountered and the overall effect of Inclement Weather on the Contract Program.   .17  Without limiting any other provision of the Contract, the Contractor acknowledges and agrees that compliance with clauses 50.12 to 50.17 (inclusive) is a precondition to the Contractor's entitlement to Claim an extension of time in respect of Inclement Weather beyond the Inclement Weather Allowance. ",Terms of Contract
"51 Delay costs and liquidated damages  Delay costs  .1  For each working day by which the time for achieving Completion is extended under clause 47 due to:  .1  a Variation (other than a Variation for the Contractor’s convenience or a Variation carried out as Daywork)  .2  failure to give the Contractor access to the Site in accordance with clause 34;   .3  subject to clause 8.9, an instruction under clause 8.8;  .4  Adverse Site Conditions that differ materially from those the Contractor should reasonably have expected at the Date of Contract (subject to clause 37.8 and Contract Information item 37);  .5  resolution of a Fault notified in accordance with clause 38.1;  .6  changes in Statutory Requirements that the Contractor should not reasonably have expected at the Date of Contract and that require changes to the Works (subject to clause 49.6);  .7  a suspension instruction under clause 53 if the need for the suspension arises from the Principal’s act or omission; or  .8  a breach of the Contract by the Principal,  the Contractor will be entitled to be paid the additional costs reasonably and necessarily incurred by the Contractor as a direct result of the delay the subject of the extension of time (as determined by the Principal's Authorised Person) up to, but not exceeding, the maximum daily amounts set out in Contract Information item 49A.  .2  Other than a claim for additional costs under clause 51.1, the Contractor will not be entitled to make, and the Principal will not be liable upon, any Claim relating to the costs of delay or disruption to the Works.  .3  The maximum daily amount stated in Contract Information item 49A1 applies where the delay is caused by the Principal’s failure to give the Contractor access to sufficient of the Site to allow the Contractor to start work, in accordance with clause 34.  .4  The maximum daily amount stated in Contract Information item 49A2 apply for any other delays for which the Contractor is entitled to delay costs. Where a delay costs rate is stated for the whole of the Works, it does not apply to delays to any individual Milestone. If delay costs rates are stated for Milestones, no separate delay costs rate applies for delays to the whole of the Works.  .5  Notwithstanding clause 51.2, the Contractor is not entitled to delay costs for any days on which it would have been delayed anyway by a cause for which it has no entitlement to delay costs.  .6  Not used.  .7  The Contractor has no remedy or entitlement connected with delay or disruption other than:  .1  the amounts to be paid in accordance with clause 51;  .2  an extension of time to any Contractual Completion Date to which it is entitled under clauses 48 or 50; or  .3  any remedy it may have under clause 74 or 75.  Liquidated damages  .8  If Contract Information item 49B states that liquidated damages do not apply, the Principal may claim general damages if the Contractor fails to achieve Completion of the Works or any Milestone by its Contractual Completion Date.  .9  If Contract Information item 49B states that liquidated damages apply and the Contractor fails to achieve Completion of the Works or any Milestone by a Contractual Completion Date to which liquidated damages apply, the Contractor will be liable to pay the Principal liquidated damages at the rate stated in Contract Information item 49B, for every day after the Contractual Completion Date, up to and including the Actual Completion Date.  ",Terms of Contract
".10  If, however, the Contract is terminated before the Contractor achieves Completion, any liquidated damages will apply only up to the date of termination of the Contract.  .11  A failure by the Principal at any time to demand payment or to deduct, withhold or set-off the liquidated damages does not amount to a waiver of, or otherwise affect, the Principal’s rights and entitlements.  .12  If any Contractual Completion Date is extended after the Contractor has paid or the Principal has deducted liquidated damages, the Principal must re-pay any excess liquidated damages to the Contractor, subject to any right of set-off.  .13  Not used.  .14  The Contractor acknowledges that the rates for liquidated damages in Contract Information item 49B are a genuine pre-estimate of the Principal’s loss and agrees that it will not challenge any rate for liquidated damages as being in the nature of a penalty. If the Contractor’s obligation to pay liquidated damages is found for any reason to be void, invalid or otherwise inoperative so as to disentitle the Principal from recovering liquidated damages, the Principal will be entitled to recover general damages for the Contractor’s failure to achieve Completion of the Works or any Milestone by its Contractual Completion Date.  52 Acceleration  .1  The Principal may issue an Acceleration Notice instructing the Contractor to accelerate progress of the Works. The Contractor must comply unless, before taking any steps to accelerate, it demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Principal that the acceleration instructed cannot reasonably be achieved.  .2  If requested in writing by the Principal, the Contractor must, within the time specified in the request, advise the Principal of:  .1  its price (calculated by reference to the rates in the Schedule of Rates, to the extent that it is reasonable to use those rates, and excluding all costs of delay or disruption) for a proposed acceleration;  and  .2  the effect of a proposed acceleration on any other matter specified by the Principal.  .3  Whenever possible, the parties must agree on the steps to be taken, and the basis for reimbursing the Contractor’s costs for acceleration, before the Contractor takes those steps.  .4  If:  .1  the Contractor achieves the acceleration instructed; and  .2  the acceleration was instructed to overcome a delay for which the Contractor is entitled to an extension of time,  the Contract Price must be adjusted as agreed, or if not agreed, the Contractor may make a Claim, that complies with clause 68.3, for an adjustment to the Contract Price to be valued in accordance with clause 47 for any unavoidable costs incurred by the Contractor additional to what it would have incurred if the Principal had not given the instruction.  .5  Other than as set out in this clause 52, the Contractor will not be entitled to make, and the Principal will not be liable upon, any Claim arising out of or in any way in connection with an Acceleration Notice.  53 Principal’s suspension  .1  The Principal may instruct the Contractor to suspend progress of the Works, and the Contractor must comply with that instruction.  .2  The Contractor must resume carrying out the Works when instructed by the Principal.  .3  If the need for the suspension arises from the Principal’s act or omission, and causes the Contractor delay, or unavoidable costs, additional to what the Contractor would have incurred had the suspension not been instructed, the Contractor may make a Claim, that complies with clause 68.3, for:  .1  an extension of time in accordance with clause 50, without the Contractor meeting the preconditions required by clause 50 other than provision of an updated Contract Program demonstrating the delays caused by the suspension;  .2  delay costs under clause 51; and ",Terms of Contract
".3  an increase in the Contract Price, to be valued in accordance with clause 47.  .4  The Contractor has no other remedy or entitlement in connection with a suspension by the Principal.  54 Contractor’s suspension  .1  If the Contractor suspends work at any time in accordance with the Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment Act 1999 (NSW), it may be entitled to an extension of time under clause 50, but despite clause 51, it will not be entitled to any payment for delay or disruption. If the Contractor is delayed, it may make a Claim, that complies with clause 68.3, for an extension of time in accordance with clause 50.  .2  Clause 54 is not intended to limit any rights of the Contractor under the Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment Act 1999 (NSW).

Provisional Sums  .4  If Contract Information item 42 states that the Contract Price includes a Provisional Sum, then:  .1  the Contractor must not carry out the work specified against that Provisional Sum unless instructed by the Principal;  .2  if the Principal does not instruct the Contractor to carry out the work, the Provisional Sum for that work must be deducted from the Contract Price; and  .3  if the Principal instructs the Contractor to carry out the work:  .1  the Contractor must comply with the instruction; and  .2  the Contract Price must be adjusted by deducting the Provisional Sum and adding:  .1  the additional reasonable cost to the Contractor of the work specified against the Provisional Sum, being the direct costs of labour, Materials and plant plus the costs of Subcontractor and Consultant work (excluding any amount payable due to default or negligence on their part or that of the Contractor) but excluding profit and overheads specified by Contract Information item 43 as included in the Provisional Sum margin; and ",Terms of Contract

The parties may agree in writing from time to time which supplies are excluded supplies.  .4  The Contractor must not issue a tax invoice in respect of any supply it makes to the Principal, other than for an excluded supply. The Contractor must give the Principal a tax invoice for an excluded supply at or before the time the Contractor makes a Payment Claim or otherwise invoices the Principal for that supply.  .5  Each party must be registered for GST and must notify the other party if it ceases to be registered for GST or to comply with any of the requirements of any taxation ruling issued by a taxation authority relating to the creation of RCTIs.  Reimbursable expenses  .6  If the Contract requires a party to pay for, reimburse or contribute to any expense, loss or outgoing (“reimbursable expense”) suffered or incurred by the other party, the amount required to be paid, reimbursed or contributed by the first party must be the sum of:  .1  the amount of the reimbursable expense net of input tax credits (if any) to which the other party is entitled in respect of the reimbursable expense; and  .2  to the extent that the other party’s recovery from the first party is consideration for a taxable supply to the first party, any GST payable in respect of that supply.  57 Prepayment  Prepayment is an advance payment against the Contract Price which provides early cash flow to the Contractor. The Prepayment is repaid by the Contractor progressively by deductions from amounts payable under the Contract. Prepayment is secured by Undertakings provided to the Principal in respect of the Prepayment. Prepayment may be utilised for any purpose related to the Contract.  .1  The Contractor may claim Prepayment, as an advance payment against the Contract Price (but not as a Payment Claim), at any time before achieving Completion of the whole of the Works if all the following apply:  .1  the total amount claimed for Prepayment is no more than the amount stated in Contract Information item 45;  .2  the Prepayment does not exceed the remaining balance of the Contract Price less any amount that the Principal considers payable by the Contractor to the Principal;  .3  no more than one-third of the stated amount for Prepayment is retained by the Contractor and the balance is assigned directly to Subcontractors, Suppliers and Consultants in the proportions notified to the Principal;  .4  the Contractor has established to the Principal’s satisfaction that the Prepayment will be utilised for a purpose related to the Contract;  .5  the Contractor has provided Undertakings to the Principal for the amounts of the Prepayment; and  .6  the Contractor has assigned to Subcontractors, Suppliers and Consultants their respective shares of the Prepayment by effective written assignments, and has notified the Principal of the assignments, including the amounts assigned to each Subcontractor.  .2  The Principal must pay the amount claimed within 14 days after the Contractor provides evidence that all the conditions in clause 57.1 have been met. ",Terms of Contract
".3  The Contractor must repay the Prepayment by way of progressive deductions from payments otherwise due under the Contract.  .4  The Principal must return Undertakings provided for Prepayment when the amount of the Prepayment has been fully repaid.  .5  The Principal may have recourse to the Undertakings provided for Prepayment if the Prepayment has not been fully repaid and:  .1  the unpaid balance of the Contract Price is insufficient to cover the outstanding balance of the Prepayment;  .2  the Contract is terminated; or  .3  the Contractor’s employment under the Contract is terminated.  58 Payment Claims  The Contract allows for progress payments by regular (usually monthly) payments or payments based on Milestone Completion or both.  .1  Subject to clauses 58.2 and 58.3, the Contractor must submit a Payment Claim to the Principal's Authorised Person each month, on the date in the month specified in Contract Information item 46A, for work carried out up to that date.  .2  For Milestones for which Contract Information item 46B states that payments will be made after they reach Completion, each Payment Claim may only include the value of work in those Milestones if they reached Completion before the specified submission date.  .3  The Contractor must submit the Final Payment Claim within the time specified in clause 61.  .4  Payment Claims must be in the form of, and include all of the information required by, Schedule 3 (Payment Claim Worksheet) or in another form agreed by the Principal.  .5  Every Payment Claim must:  .1  identify the work and Materials to which the Payment Claim relates;  .2  state the value of that work and those Materials;  .3  identify and state the amount the Contractor claims for any other Claim that the Principal has agreed or is required to pay under clause 68 or any other provision of the Contract;  .4  state the amount of interest, if any, that the Contractor claims under clause 62;  and  .5  state the Claimed Amount, after allowing for retention of the Completion Amount specified in clause 60 and for payments already made.  .6  Every Payment Claim must be accompanied by:  .1  a completed and true Combined Subcontractor’s Statement and Supporting Statement in the form of Schedule 6, executed on the date of the Payment Claim;  .2  all relevant calculations;  .3  all relevant Conformance Records; and  .4  any other information specified in the Contract.  Unfixed Materials  .7  Payment Claims must not include any amount for Materials intended for incorporation in the Works but not yet incorporated unless all of the following conditions are satisfied:  .1  the Principal has agreed in writing to pay the Contractor for the unincorporated Materials;  .2  where the value of the unincorporated Materials is greater than $100,000, the Contractor provides before or with the Payment Claim:  .1  an Undertaking equal to the value of the unincorporated Materials (to be returned when the Materials are incorporated into the Works); and  .2  a statement in the terms in Schedule 11 (Statement regarding Materials);   .3  the Contractor provides evidence before or with the Payment Claim that:  .1  the unincorporated Materials are, or upon payment will become, the property of the Principal free of any Encumbrance; and ",Terms of Contract
".2  the unincorporated Materials are clearly identified as the property of the Principal and are insured for their full value; and  .4  for any unincorporated Materials imported or to be imported into Australia, the Contractor has given the Principal a clean on board bill of lading drawn or endorsed to the order of the Principal, appropriate insurance certificates and a Customs invoice.  .8  The Contractor warrants that no Encumbrance exists over any Materials paid for by the Principal or incorporated into the Works.  .9  Upon the Materials becoming the property of the Principal, they are entrusted to the Contractor for the purpose of carrying out the Works and the Contractor is solely liable for their care.  .10  If the Contract or the Contractor’s employment under the Contract is terminated by the Principal, the Contractor must ensure that, in respect of any unincorporated Materials for which payment has been made or which have been appropriated to the Contract, the Principal may enter upon any premises where the Materials are stored and take possession of these Materials.  59 Payments  .1  Within 10 Business Days after being served a Payment Claim by the Contractor, the Principal must provide a Payment Schedule to the Contractor that:  .1  identifies the Payment Claim to which it relates;  .2  indicates the amount the Principal proposes to pay, as the Scheduled Amount; and  .3  if the Scheduled Amount is less than the Claimed Amount, provides reasons explaining why it is less and why any money is being withheld. Reasons why the Scheduled Amount is less than the Claimed Amount may include failure by the Contractor to comply with any outstanding obligations under:  .1  clause 33 (Security);  .2  clause 27 (Insurance);  .3  clause 58.6.1 (Combined Subcontractor’s Statement and Supporting Statement -Schedule 6);  In accordance with the relevant legislation identified in Schedule 6, the Contractor is liable to penalty notices, issued by NSW Fair Trading, and other action, if an incomplete or no Supporting Statement is provided.  .4  clauses 58.6.2 to 58.6.4 (other items to accompany a Payment Claim); and  .5  clause 58.7 (Unfixed Materials).  .2  The Principal must pay the Contractor the Scheduled Amount within 15 Business Days after being served with the Payment Claim.  .3  Unless stated otherwise in the Contract, all payments to the Contractor must be made by electronic funds transfer to the Contractor’s account notified to the Principal for that purpose. Changes to the Contractor’s account details must be notified in accordance with protocols established by the Principal.  .4  Payment by the Principal is payment on account only and is not evidence that the Principal accepts the value, quantity or quality of work or that the Contractor has complied with the Contract or that the Contractor has any particular entitlement.  59A Security of Payment  .1  The Contractor agrees that:  .1  a Payment Claim submitted to the Principal's Authorised Person under clause 58 is received by the Principal's Authorised Person as agent for the Principal;  .2  the Principal's Authorised Person will issue Payment Schedules and carry out all other functions of the Principal under the Security of Payment Act as agent of the Principal; and  .3  the Scheduled Amount referred to in the Payment Schedule is, for the purposes of the Security of Payment Act, the amount of the ""progress payment"" (as defined in ",Terms of Contract
"the Security of Payment Act) calculated in accordance with the terms of the Contract which the Contractor is entitled to in respect of the Contract.  .2  Failure by the Principal's Authorised Person to set out in a Payment Schedule an amount which the Principal is entitled to retain, deduct, withhold or set-off from the amount which would otherwise be payable to the Contractor by the Principal will not prejudice the Principal’s right to subsequently exercise its right to retain, deduct, withhold or set-off any amount under the Contract.  60 Completion Amount  The Completion Amount is intended to provide an incentive; the earlier the Contractor achieves defect-free Completion of the whole of the Works, the earlier the Completion Amount is paid.  .1  If Contract Information item 47 specifies a Completion Amount, the Contractor may claim it in the next Payment Claim after Completion of the whole of the Works or, if applicable, a specified Milestone, subject to the Principal’s right to set-off under clause 63.  .2  The Principal will retain the Completion Amount from payments when the amount paid to the Contractor exceeds 50% of the Contract Price at the Date of Contract. Until the Completion Amount has been retained in full, the amount retained against each payment must not exceed 50% of the value of the payment. Thereafter, the Completion Amount will be held until the Contractor claims it in accordance with clause 60.1.  .3  The Principal will own any interest earned on the monies retained for the Completion Amount.  61 Final payment  Clause 61 contains provisions which apply to the Contractor’s Final Payment Claim and the Principal’s Final Payment Schedule.  .1  The Contractor must submit a Final Payment Claim within 13 weeks after achieving Completion of the whole of the Works. The Final Payment Claim must include any Claim not previously included in a Payment Claim. Subject to the Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment Act 1999 (NSW), any Claim not submitted before or with the Final Payment Claim is barred.  .2  Within 10 Business Days after receiving the Final Payment Claim or, if the Contractor has not submitted a Final Payment Claim, within 15 weeks after the whole of the Works reaches Completion, the Principal must provide a Final Payment Schedule to the Contractor.  .3  If the Principal proposes to make no payment to the Contractor and claims that the Contractor must pay the Principal money, the Final Payment Schedule must state the amount that the Principal claims the Contractor must pay, and include reasons and particulars supporting that claim.  .4  Payments identified in the Final Payment Schedule as due from the Contractor to the Principal must be made within 14 days after the Final Payment Schedule is provided. Payments due from the Principal to the Contractor must be made in accordance with clause 59.   .5  The issue of the Final Payment Schedule is conclusive evidence that all necessary adjustments to the Contract Price have been made and all entitlements of the Contractor have been met, except for those required by:  .1  arithmetical error; or  .2  resolution of:  .1  any Claim made in accordance with clause 61.1;  .2  any Issue properly notified under clause 69 prior to the Final Payment Claim; or  .3  any Issue arising out of the Final Payment Schedule, but only if it is notified to the Principal within 28 days after the date of the Final Payment Schedule.  .6  The Contractor’s liability under the Contract or otherwise is not affected by the issue of the Final Payment Schedule. The Contractor’s liability continues until any limitation period under statute expires. ",Terms of Contract
"62 Interest on late payments  .1  A party which fails to make a payment within the time specified in the Contract must pay interest to the other party on the unpaid amount, at the rate stated in Contract Information item 48, for the period the payment is late.  63 Set-off  .1  If the Principal claims a sum, including a debt due, in connection with the Contract or any other contract between the Principal and the Contractor, the Principal may:  .1  withhold, deduct or set-off the claimed sum against any amount to which the Contractor is otherwise entitled in connection with the Contract; and  .2  without limiting the terms of the Undertakings, make a demand against the Undertakings provided under the Contract for any amount of the claimed sum in excess of the amount to which the Contractor is otherwise entitled.  Completion  64 Early use  .1  Before the Contractor achieves Completion, the Principal, or anyone authorised by the Principal, may use or occupy all or any part of the Works which is sufficiently complete and then:  .1  the Contractor’s responsibilities are not affected, except if they are reduced under clauses 26.3 or 26.7 or if the Principal, or anyone authorised by the Principal to use or occupy any part of the Works, causes the Contractor’s work to be hindered; and  .2  the Principal becomes responsible for any additional insurance required.  .2  If the Principal requires use or occupation of any part of the Works before the Contractor achieves Completion, the Principal must give not less than 21 days notice in writing to the Contractor and must specify the date on which use or occupation is required and those parts to be used or occupied.  .3  The Contractor must assist and cooperate with those using or occupying the Works.  .4  No later than 21 days after receipt of a notice under clause 64.2, the Contractor must provide to the Principal all the documents and other things listed in the definition of Completion that are relevant to the parts of the Works to be used or occupied.  65 Completion  The Contract requires defect-free Completion. Completion applies to any Milestone as well as to the whole of the Works.  .1  The Contractor must achieve Completion by the Contractual Completion Date.  .2  When the parties, each acting reasonably, agree that Completion has been achieved, the Principal must give the Contractor a notice stating the Actual Completion Date.  66 Close-out workshop  The close-out workshop is an opportunity to review the management of the Contract. It is also used to collect and provide feedback to the parties to enable them to improve the overall communication and management process for any possible future contract.  .1  The Principal must convene a close-out workshop within 21 days after Completion of the whole of the Works or such other period as the parties agree.  .2  The parties must attend the close-out workshop and must jointly decide who else will attend. Clause 6.4 applies to the costs of the workshop.  67 Defects after Completion  .1  At any time after Completion:  .1  the Principal may instruct the Contractor to make good any Defect within the time specified in a Defect Notice;  .2  if the Contractor fails to make good the Defect in the time specified in the Defect Notice, the provisions of clauses 45.3 and 45.4 will apply; and ",Terms of Contract
".3  the Principal may instruct a Variation in connection with any Defect instead of requiring the Defect to be made good under clause 67.1.1.  .2  Clause 67 does not reduce the Contractor’s liability, whether arising under the Contract or otherwise. The Contractor’s liability continues until any limitation period under statute expires.  .3  Clause 67 does not affect the Principal’s rights under clause 46. ",Terms of Contract
"Claim and Issue resolution  This section provides a step-by-step procedure for handling Claims and Issues.  Claim resolution  68 Contractor’s Claims  .1  If the Contractor makes:  .1  a Claim under a provision of the Contract that does not specify a time for making the Claim; or  .2  a Claim in connection with the Contract or the Works, but not under a provision of the Contract,  the Claim must be submitted within 28 days after the later of the start of the event giving rise to the Claim; and the time the event should have become known to the Contractor, with reasonable diligence on its part.  .2  If the Contractor fails to make a Claim within the time specified in the Contract:  .1  the Principal will not be liable (insofar as it is possible to exclude such liability) upon any Claim by the Contractor; and  .2  the Contractor will be absolutely barred from making any Claim against the Principal,  arising out of, or in connection with, the relevant direction or fact, matter or thing (as the case may be) to which the Claim applied.  .3  Each Claim must include information sufficient for the Principal to assess the Claim, including the factual and legal basis, detailed quantification and responses by the Contractor to the questions set out in paragraphs 1.1.1 and 1.1.2 of Schedule 5 (Expert Determination Procedure). The Claim must also include the effect of the event giving rise to the Claim on both the Contract Price and Contractual Completion Date(s).  To assist in valuation, where practicable, a Claim for an adjustment to the Contract Price is to include a break-up costs similar to that set out in clause 47.6.  .4  If a Claim does not comply with clause 68.3, the Principal may, but is not obliged to, give the Contractor an opportunity to make the Claim compliant. Clause 68.7 applies to a claim that does not comply with clause 68.3.  .5  If a Claim complies with clause 68.3 and the Principal agrees that the Contractor is entitled to an adjustment to the Contract Price or an adjustment to Contractual Completion Date(s):  .1  any claimed adjustment to Contractual Completion Date(s) is to be valued in accordance with clause 50.  .2  any claimed adjustment to the Contract Price, including any applicable Delay Costs, is to be valued in accordance with clause 47; and  .3  the parties are to follow the process in clause 47.1 to resolve the adjustments claimed.  .6  If the Principal agrees to a Claim involving money, the Contractor may claim the agreed amount only by including it in a Payment Claim.  .7  If a Claim is rejected, not agreed or has not been referred to a Valuer within 28 days after the Contractor has provided the information specified in clause 68.3 it will become an Unresolved Claim, and the Contractor may notify the Principal of an Issue under clause 69.1.  .8  The provisions of clauses 68.2 to 68.7 apply generally to all Claims, whether made under clause 68 or under another provision of the Contract, unless determination of the Claim is regulated by a separate procedure under any applicable legislation.

"Issue resolution  Generally, the aim of the Contract is for the parties to resolve matters through discussions as soon as possible and within the times specified. Further steps are only needed if the representatives of the parties who are involved in day to day management of the Contract are unable to resolve matters themselves.  69 Notification of Issue  .1  The Contractor may dispute an assessment or instruction of the Principal, or seek resolution of an Unresolved Claim, by giving notice to the Principal (with a copy to the Principal’s senior executive named in Contract Information item 7) of an Issue within 28 days after notification of the assessment or instruction, or within 28 days after it becomes an Unresolved Claim.  .2  Either party may give notice to the other (with a copy to that party’s senior executive) of an Issue (excluding an Issue referred to in clause 69.1, but including a claim by the Principal) about the meaning or effect of the Contract, or about any matter connected with the Contract, within 28 days after becoming aware of the Issue.  .3  Subject to clause 69.6, the parties must follow the Issue resolution procedures in clauses 69, 70 and 71 before either commences litigation or takes similar action.  .4  If notice of an Issue under clause 69.1 or 69.2 is given outside the time prescribed by those clauses, the party giving the notice is not entitled to claim or recover interest for the period before the notice was given. This clause does not affect the absolute time bar in clause 61.  .5  The Principal is not liable to pay damages (whether in contract, for negligence or otherwise) for making an incorrect assessment or instruction.  .6  The Issue resolution procedure in clauses 69, 70 and 71 does not prevent a party from seeking an urgent declaration or injunction from a court.  70 Resolution by senior executives  .1  If a party gives notice of an Issue under clause 69, the senior executives named in Contract Information items 7 and 11 must promptly confer to try to resolve the Issue.  .2  A party is not entitled to refer an Issue to Expert Determination until 28 days after giving notice of an Issue.  The Senior Executives can extend the period for resolution by agreement in writing.  .3  A party may only refer an Issue to Expert Determination by giving a notice specifying the Issue to the other party (with a copy to that party’s senior executive) within the time stated in Contract Information item 51.  .4  Subject to clause 69.6, an Issue for which notice has not been given in accordance with clause 70.3 is barred from Expert Determination or litigation or similar action.  71 Expert Determination  .1  The representative of the Principal for the purposes of clause 71 is the person named in Contract Information item 52. This person may differ from the Principal’s Authorised Person.  .2  If an Issue is to be referred to Expert Determination under clause 70, the parties must endeavour to agree on the Expert to be engaged. If they cannot agree within 28 days after receipt of a notice under clause 70.3, the Expert will be nominated (on the application of either party) by the person named in Contract Information item 53. That person must not nominate:  .1  an employee of the Principal or the Contractor;  .2  a person who has been connected with the Works or the Contract; or  .3  a person who the Principal and the Contractor have already considered and not been able to agree on.

"Termination  73 Termination for Contractor’s Default or Insolvency  .1  The Principal may terminate the Contractor’s employment under the Contract for Contractor’s Default or Contractor’s Insolvency by giving notice in accordance with clause 73.  .2  Nothing in clause 73 affects or negates the Principal’s common law rights to terminate or for damages.  .3  In the case of Contractor’s Default, the Principal must first give the Contractor notice that it has 7 days (or any such longer period determined by the Principal in its absolute discretion) after receipt of that notice to remedy the Contractor’s Default.  .4  If the Contractor fails to:  .1  give the Principal a notice containing clear evidence that it has remedied a Contractor’s Default; or  .2  propose steps reasonably acceptable to the Principal to remedy the Contractor’s Default,  the Principal may give the Contractor a notice terminating its employment under the Contract.  If a right to terminate exists at common law, a notice to terminate at common law may be given without first giving notice to remedy a Contractor’s Default.  .5  In the case of Contractor’s Insolvency, the Principal may give the Contractor a notice terminating its employment under the Contract.  .6  If the Principal terminates the Contractor’s employment under clause 73 it may, at its sole discretion, employ others to complete the Works and all the following will then apply:  .1  The Contractor must leave the Site as soon as reasonably practicable and remove all Temporary Work and Materials it has brought onto the Site, apart from any Temporary Work and Materials identified by the Principal as being necessary to have the Works completed.  .2  The Contractor must assign to the Principal the Contractor’s rights and benefits in all its contracts and agreements in connection with the Works, warranties and unconditional undertakings, bank guarantees, insurance bonds, other security of a similar nature or purpose and retention held by the Contractor, with effect from the date of termination of its employment under the Contract.  .3  The Contractor must consent to a novation to the Principal or its nominee of all Subcontracts and its other contracts concerning the Works, as required by the Principal. The Principal may at any time make payments and may deduct, withhold or set-off any amounts to be paid under the novated contracts from amounts otherwise payable to the Contractor or from any Undertakings given on the Contractor’s behalf.  .4  The Contractor must do everything and sign all documents necessary to give effect to clause 73, and it irrevocably appoints the Principal as its attorney to do this in its name if it fails to do so.  .5  If, on Completion, the cost to the Principal of completing the Works exceeds the amount that would have been paid to the Contractor to complete the Works, then the difference will be a debt due from the Contractor to the Principal.  .6  The Principal may make provisional assessments of the amounts payable to the Principal under clause 73.6.5 and may, without limiting any other right of recourse, demand them against the Undertakings.  74 Termination for Principal’s convenience  .1  The Principal may terminate the Contract, by giving notice with effect from the date stated in the notice, for its convenience and without the need to give reasons.

The Contractor’s sole remedy for the Principal’s breach will be the applicable amounts referred to in clause 74.4.  76 Termination notices  .1  Notices under clauses 73, 74 and 75 must be in writing and be delivered by hand, registered post or equivalent, or email.  77 Survival  .1  Without limiting the survival of any clause by operation of law, clauses 23, 24, 25 and 26 and all indemnities in the Contract survive termination.

"Notes  1.  This form is prepared for the purpose of section 175B of the Workers Compensation Act 1987 (NSW), Schedule 2 Part 5 of the Payroll Tax Act 2007 (NSW), section 127 of the Industrial Relations Act 1996 (NSW) and sections 13(7) and 13(9) of the Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment Act 1999 (NSW). If this form is completed in accordance with these provisions, a principal contractor is relieved of liability for workers compensation premiums, payroll tax and remuneration payable by the subcontractor.  A principal contractor can be generally defined to include any person who has entered into a contract for the carrying out of work by another person (or other legal entity called the subcontractor) and where employees of the subcontractor are engaged in carrying out the work which is in connection with the principal contractor’s business.  2.  For the purpose of this Subcontractor’s Statement, a principal contractor is a person (or other legal entity), who has entered into a contract with another person (or other legal entity) referred to as the subcontractor, and employees/workers of that subcontractor will perform the work under contract. The work must be connected to the business undertaking of the principal contractor.  3.  Provide the unique contract number, title, or other information that identifies the contract.  4.  In order to meet the requirements of s127 of the Industrial Relations Act 1996 (NSW), a statement in relation to remuneration must state the period to which the statement relates. For sequential Statements ensure that the dates provide continuous coverage.  Section 127(6) of the Industrial Relations Act 1996 (NSW) defines remuneration ‘as remuneration or other amounts payable to relevant employees by legislation, or under an industrial instrument, in connection with work done by the employees.’  Section 127(11) of the Industrial Relations Act 1996 (NSW) states ‘to avoid doubt, this section extends to a principal contractor who is the owner or occupier of a building for the carrying out of work in connection with the building so long as the building is owned or occupied by the principal contractor in connection with a business undertaking of the principal contractor.  5.  Provide the date of the most recent payment claim.  6.  For Workers Compensation purposes an exempt employer is an employer who pays less than $7,500 annually, who does not employ an apprentice or trainee and is not a member of a group.  7.  In completing the Subcontractor’s Statement, a contractor declares that workers compensation insurance premiums payable up to and including the date(s) on the Statement have been paid, and all premiums owing during the term of the contract will be paid.  8.  In completing the Subcontractor’s Statement, a subcontractor declares that all remuneration payable to relevant employees for work under the contract has been paid.  9.  In completing the Subcontractor’s Statement, a subcontractor declares that all payroll tax payable relating to the work undertaken has been paid.  10.  It is important to note that a business could be both a subcontractor and a principal contractor, if a business ‘in turn’ engages subcontractors to carry out the work. If your business engages a subcontractor, you are to also obtain Subcontractor’s Statements from your contractors.  Statement Retention  The principal contractor receiving a Subcontractor’s Statement must keep a copy of the Statement for the periods stated in the respective legislation. This is currently up to seven years.  Offences in respect of a false Statement  In terms of s127(8) of the Industrial Relations Act 1996 (NSW), a person who gives the principal a written statement knowing it to be false is guilty of an offence if:  (a)  the person is the subcontractor  (b)  the person is authorised by the subcontractor to give the statement on behalf of the subcontractor; or  (c)  the person holds out or represents that the person is authorised by the subcontractor to give the statement on behalf of the subcontractor.  Maximum penalty: 100 penalty units.  In terms of s175B of the Workers Compensation Act 1987 (NSW) and clause 18 of Schedule 2 of the Payroll Tax Act 2007 (NSW) a person who gives the principal contractor a written statement knowing it to be false is guilty of an offence.  In terms of s 13(8) of the Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment Act 1999 (NSW) a head contractor who serves a payment claim accompanied by a supporting statement knowing that the statement is false or misleading in a material particular in the particular circumstances is guilty of an offence.

The Concessionaire may at any time request any reasonable amendments to any Current Plan by submitting an updated version of the amended Current Plan to RMS for RMS’ consent.

Any such diversion can be varied, removed, or itself subject to further diversions from time to time on no less than an additional 24 hours notice to the Concessionaire.    RMS may from time to time on no less than 14 days notice to the Concessionaire vary a Current Route or Bridge Licensed Area by including such minor diversions to that Current Route or Bridge Licensed Area as are required by RMS for the purposes of:  (i)  the implementation of any capital projects by RMS;  (ii)  any planned repairs and/or maintenance by RMS; or  (iii)  any other reasonable requirement of RMS.  A Current Route or Bridge Licensed Area will from the commencement of the application of the relevant diversion be deemed to be varied so as to include the diversion and exclude that part of the Current Route or Bridge Licensed Area which RMS decides is to be avoided due to the diversion. Any such diversion can be varied, removed, or itself be subject to further diversions from time to time for the purposes of:  (iv)  unplanned repairs and/or maintenance, in which case the 24 hour notice period in clause (<>)7.3(a) applies; or  (v)  any of the reasons specified in clauses (<>)7.3(b)(i) to (<>)7.3(b)(iii), in which case RMS must provide no less than 14 days notice to the Concessionaire.   RMS will at each meeting of the meetings of the Operations Committee contemplated in clause (<>)21.3(e)(ii) provide to the Concessionaire a copy of its scheduled maintenance plan for the Bridge for the next 6 month period or an update on any material changes to the last provided scheduled maintenance plan.

For the avoidance of doubt, a reference to a Chord in the table above includes all catwalks associated with that Chord. To the extent any of the activities described in clause (<>)8.5(a)(ii) are affected by the New Year’s Eve Fireworks, RMS will notify the Concessionaire of any periods during which the Concessionaire will not have access to the relevant Bridge Licensed Areas to undertake the relevant activity.   Despite clauses (<>)8.5(a) and (<>)8.5(b), if any fireworks remain undetonated on the Bridge after 8 a.m. on New Year’s Day, then no Current Routes will apply for a further period nominated by RMS (but not exceeding 24 hours in any given yConcession Year).   If in any Concession Year, there is no Licensed Area relating to a Current Route available to the Concessionaire for periods which in aggregate exceed 56 hours and 1 minute (or 80 hours and 1 minute in the event of undetonated fireworks as contemplated by clause (<>)8.5(c)) due to New Year’s Eve Fireworks, then in respect of any additional period for which there is no access to any such Licensed Area available to the Concessionaire due to New Year’s Eve Fireworks:  (i)  RMS must pay the Concessionaire such reasonable compensation in respect of that period as is applicable in the circumstances (taking into ",Terms of Contract
" account that many potential Customers for such additional period will become Customers at other times in the vicinity of the additional period); or  (ii)  RMS may elect for such compensation to be paid by RMS by way of set-off against any debt or amount next due from the Concessionaire to RMS.  For the purposes of this clause (<>)8.5(d), the parties agree that “reasonable compensation” will constitute compensation to compensate the Concessionaire for any loss of net revenue suffered during the relevant period whilst also having regard to any revenue received by the Concessionaire before, during and after the New Year’s Eve Fireworks. The parties agree to refer any Dispute arising under this clause (<>)8.5 to the decision of an expert in accordance with clause (<>)22.4.   RMS and the Concessionaire acknowledge and agree that in addition to the Current Routes:  (i)  the Northern Group Walks, any Approved New Activity and any other new Tourism Activities approved by RMS under this agreement that involve Bridge Licensed Areas might be subject to requirements and restrictions of City of Sydney Council and other Government Agencies in relation to the New Year’s Eve Fireworks and the Concessionaire must comply with such restrictions and requirements;  (ii)  to the extent access to undertake Northern Group Walks, or any other Approved New Activity or any other Tourism Activities approved by RMS under this agreement, and in each case which is undertaken on the Bridge Licensed Areas, is suspended in its entirety due to the staging of the New Year’s Eve Fireworks, the compensation regime set out in clause (<>)8.5(d) that applies where no Current Routes are available will equally apply to each of the Northern Group Walks, Approved New Activity and any new Tourism Activity (as applicable) on a separable basis; and  (iii)  the table in clause (<>)8.5(b) is subject to change as notified by RMS to the Concessionaire based on any future arrangements agreed between RMS and the City of Sydney Council, North Sydney Council or any other Government Agency in relation to the Northern Group Walks, Approved New Activity or any other new Tourism Activities approved by RMS under this agreement in the Bridge Licensed Areas.  8.6 Special Events   The Concessionaire acknowledges that all or some Current Routes may not be available (and therefore that the Concessionaire may not have access to any Top Chord, Bottom Chord or Summit Point) if the Bridge is required for a Special Event during the Term, and similarly other Bridge Licensed Areas may not be available. RMS is not aware of any such Special Events as at the Execution Date. RMS does not anticipate that the total of such periods in relation to Licensed Areas relating to Current Routes, and any New Tourism Activity or other Tourism Activities which are approved by RMS under this agreement, and in each case which is undertaken on the Bridge Licensed Areas, during the Term will exceed 240 hours in each case and if it does, then clause (<>)8.6(c) will apply.   Whilst RMS anticipates that it will be able to provide 6 months notice to the Concessionaire of the relevant Special Event, RMS cannot guarantee a particular period of notice. However, RMS will provide such reasonable notice to the Concessionaire of the period of access to the Licensed Areas required under clause ",Terms of Contract

For the purposes of this clause (<>)8.6(c), the parties agree that “reasonable compensation” will constitute compensation to compensate the Concessionaire for any loss of net revenue suffered during the relevant period whilst also having regard to any revenue received by the Concessionaire before, during and after the relevant Special Event.

During the construction and installation of those cranes, it may be possible (although as at the Execution Date, RMS regards it as unlikely) that for particular periods there will be no Current Routes which include access to either the south eastern Top Chord or the south western Top Chord.

RMS may attach reasonable conditions to its consent under clause (<>)8.8(b) and if it does so, the Concessionaire must comply with those conditions. The Concessionaire acknowledges that such reasonable conditions include without limitation:  (i)  that RMS may notify the Concessionaire that RMS (instead of the Concessionaire) will be responsible for making part or all of the relevant alterations or additions contemplated by clause (<>)8.8(b) except in relation to the Licensed Areas relating to the Concessionaire’s Office or the Bridge Experience Centre, in which case:  (A)  RMS will ensure that the relevant works are carried out promptly and in a proper and workmanlike manner; and  (B)  the Concessionaire will have an opportunity to inspect and approve such works once completed and may instruct RMS to make any modifications to such works (acting reasonably) but only to the extent necessary so that the works have been carried out in a proper and workmanlike manner; and  (ii)  that the Concessionaire must pay for the reasonable cost of the relevant works.

To the extent RMS or any RMS Related Party requires any access to the Licensed Areas relating to the Concessionaire’s Office or the Bridge Experience Centre which is not already contemplated under this agreement, RMS must ensure that in the exercise of that right of access, it uses all reasonable endeavours to minimise inconvenience to the Concessionaire.  9 Improvements, repairs and maintenance  9.1 Definitions  In this clause (<>)9 and to the extent otherwise used in this agreement:   Bridge Structure means:  (i)  the structural parts of the Bridge arch including the Chords, truss vertical, arch truss and hangers; and  (ii)  the structural parts of the Approach Spans.

The payment of RMS Damages does not in any way relieve the Concessionaire of any of its obligations and liabilities under this agreement.   This clause (<>)26.2 continues to operate if this agreement is terminated. It does not limit any right of RMS to recover damages for any other loss.

If RMS notifies the Concessionaire that the Action Plan:  (i)  does not address the breach to RMS’ satisfaction, then RMS may require the Concessionaire to provide an amended Action Plan, with this process to continue until RMS approves the Action Plan; or  (ii)  is approved, then the Concessionaire must promptly implement and comply with such Action Plan.   If an Action Plan is in effect:  (i)  the Concessionaire must provide to RMS a monthly report on its implementation of, and performance against, the Action Plan; and ",Terms of Contract

" 28.3 Without prejudice   RMS’ rights under this clause (<>)28 are without limitation to any other rights that RMS may have either under this agreement, or at Law or in equity.   RMS is not obliged to exercise any right under this clause (<>)28 or to cure any Step-in Event.   The exercise (or failure to exercise) by RMS of its rights under clause (<>)28 will not limit RMS’ rights under this agreement, in Law or equity.   Monetary damages may not be an adequate remedy for breach of this clause (<>)28 and a party may seek specific performance or an injunction as a remedy for such breach or where such breach is anticipated, in addition to any other remedies available under this agreement, at Law or in equity.  Termination  29.1 Expiry  This agreement will terminate without any further action required at the expiry of the Term.  29.2 Breach Cure Plan   If the Concessionaire breaches an Essential Term and the breach is capable of remedy but cannot reasonably be remedied within 20 Business Days of receiving notice from RMS requiring that breach to be remedied, then RMS may notify the Concessionaire of that breach and require the Concessionaire to submit a corrective cure plan to RMS (Breach Cure Plan) within 10 Business Days following receipt of that notice.   The Breach Cure Plan must contain full details of all steps which the Concessionaire is taking, or proposes to take, in order to correct the issue that caused the breach, the timeframes for carrying out those steps and such other information as RMS may reasonably require.

If a Breach Cure Plan is in effect, the Concessionaire must provide to RMS a monthly report on its implementation of, and performance against, the Breach Cure Plan.  29.3 Termination Events   Each of the following events is a Termination Event: ",Terms of Contract
" (i)  the Concessionaire breaches an Essential Term and the breach is not capable of remedy and RMS has formed the view (acting reasonably) that there are no reasonable requirements that can be met by the Concessionaire to overcome the consequences of, or compensate RMS for, that breach;  (ii)  the Concessionaire breaches an Essential Term and:  (A)  the breach is capable of remedy and the Concessionaire fails to remedy the breach within 20 Business Days of receiving notice from RMS requiring the breach to be remedied; or  (B)  the breach is capable of remedy but cannot reasonably be remedied within such 20 Business Day period, and the Concessionaire fails to use its best endeavours to promptly implement and comply with the relevant Breach Cure Plan approved by RMS under clause (<>)29.2(c)(ii); or  (iii)  within a 3 month period the Concessionaire commits 3 or more breaches of the same or similar obligations (but which does not include any breach of a KPI) and, after RMS has notified the Concessionaire that a further breach will entitle RMS to terminate this agreement, the Concessionaire commits a similar breach of the same or similar obligation within 3 months of that notice;  (iv)  the Concessionaire is unable to perform all or substantially all of the Tourism Activities due to a Force Majeure Event for a continuous period of 180 calendar days (or any extension to this period approved by RMS) except where that Force Majeure Event occurs or arises directly as a result of the action or inaction (as the case may be) of RMS;  (v)  an Insolvency Event occurs in relation to the Concessionaire and is not cured within 20 Business Days after the Concessionaire has given RMS notice of the relevant Insolvency Event; or  (vi)  the Concessionaire fails to use reasonable endeavours to implement and comply with the KPI Cure Plan under clause (<>)6.4(d).   Despite clauses (<>)29.3(a)(i) and (<>)29.3(a)(ii), a one-time breach of this agreement by the Concessionaire for which RMS reasonably considers damages are an adequate remedy is not a Termination Event, provided that the Concessionaire pays such damages promptly following demand by RMS.   Each Termination Event is an additional, separate and independent event and no one Termination Event limits the generality of another Termination Event.  29.4 Termination by RMS   If a Termination Event occurs, then RMS may by notice to the Concessionaire terminate this agreement (Termination Notice) with immediate effect or with effect on such later date as is specified in such notice.

RMS and the Concessionaire acknowledge that the exercise by RMS of its rights under clause (<>)8.3(a) or clause (<>)8.4(a) in the circumstances contemplated in these clauses, does not limit the operation of this clause (<>)29.6 if those circumstances otherwise constitute a Force Majeure Event.  30 Business continuity  30.1 Business continuity outcomes  The Concessionaire acknowledges that RMS is seeking to achieve the following outcomes on expiry or termination of the Term:   continuity of the performance of activities substantially identical to the Tourism Activities;   successfully transferring the performance of the Concession to any Successor Concessionaire in a timely and orderly manner;   no inconvenience to Customers; and   no degradation to the safety and security of the Bridge including associated safety infrastructure and systems.  30.2 Handback Plan   The Concessionaire must provide a Handback Plan to RMS in draft form before the first anniversary of the Commencement Date for consent by RMS (acting reasonably).

The failure of the Principal to set out in a payment schedule an amount which it is entitled to retain, deduct, withhold or set off under this Deed will not prejudice its right to subsequently exercise such right.  17.3 Payments  The Principal must within 15 Business Days following receipt of a payment claim, pay the amount stated in the payment schedule or the amount claimed by the Professional Services Contractor in its payment claim (as the case may be).  Where the Principal has notified the Professional Services Contractor in accordance with clause 25(h)(iv) that it no longer proposes to issue a RCTI for a taxable supply made by the Professional Services Contractor for the Principal, the Professional Services Contractor must, within 2 Business Days after receipt of the payment schedule issued by the Principal’s Representative under clause 17.2 give the Principal’s Representative a tax invoice (which complies with the GST Law) for the amount of the payment schedule.

The Professional Services Contractor must ensure that a copy of any written communication it delivers to the Principal of whatever nature in relation to the SOP Act, including a payment claim under the SOP Act, is provided to the Principal’s Representative at the same time.   In responding to the Professional Services Contractor under the SOP Act, the Principal’s Representative acts as the agent of the Principal and the Principal authorises the Principal’s Representative to issue payment schedules on its behalf (without affecting the Principal’s right to issue a payment schedule itself).   If, within the time allowed by the SOP Act for the service of a payment schedule by the Principal, the Principal does not:  (i)  serve the payment schedule itself; or  (ii)  notify the Professional Services Contractor that the Principal’s Representative does not have authority from the Principal to issue the payment schedule on its behalf,  then a payment schedule issued by the Principal’s Representative under this Deed which relates to the period relevant to the payment schedule will be taken to be the payment schedule for the purpose of the SOP Act (whether or not it is expressly stated to be a payment schedule).

If an adjudication occurs under the SOP Act, and the Principal has paid an adjudicated amount to the Professional Services Contractor:  (i)  the amount will be taken into account by the Principal in issuing a payment schedule under clause 17.2;  (ii)  if it is subsequently determined pursuant to the Deed that the Professional Services Contractor was not entitled under the Deed to payment of some or all of the adjudicated amount that was paid by the Principal (""overpayment""), the overpayment will be a debt due and payable by the Professional Services Contractor to the Principal which the Professional Services Contractor must pay to the Principal upon demand and in respect of which the Professional Services Contractor is not entitled to claim or exercise any set-off, counterclaim, deduction or similar right of defence; and  (iii)  if the adjudicator’s determination is quashed, overturned or declared to be void, the adjudicated amount then becomes a debt due and payable by the Professional Services Contractor to the Principal upon demand and in respect of which the Professional Services Contractor is not entitled to claim or exercise any set-off, counterclaim, deduction or similar right of defence.

The Professional Services Contractor agrees not to commence proceedings to recover any amount withheld by the Principal pursuant to a payment withholding request served on the Principal in accordance with division 2A of Part 3 of the SOP Act.   Any amount paid by the Principal pursuant to section 26C of the SOP Act will be a debt due from the Professional Services Contractor to the Principal.   If the Principal withholds money pursuant to a payment withholding request served on the Principal pursuant to division 2A of Part 3 of the SOP Act and the Professional Services Contractor:  (i)  pays the amount claimed to be due under the adjudication application to which the payment withholding claim relates; or ",Annexures
"(ii)  becomes aware that the adjudication application to which the payment withholding claim relates has been withdrawn,  then the Professional Services Contractor must so notify the Principal within 5 days of the occurrence of the event under the clauses 17.6(l)(i) and 17.6(l)(ii) (as applicable) by providing to the Principal a statement in writing in the form of a statutory declaration together with such other evidence as the Principal may require evidencing that the amount has been paid or the adjudication application has been withdrawn (as the case may be).  18 TIME  18.1 Time for Commencement and programming  The Professional Services Contractor must immediately commence the performance of the Services.

The Professional Services Contractor is not entitled to make a claim for reimbursement or an extension of time from the Principal or the State of NSW for such costs.

Date  NOTE: Where required above, this Statement must be accompanied by the relevant Certificate of Currency to comply with section 175B of the Workers Compensation Act 1987.  Notes  1.  This form is prepared for the purpose of section 175B of the Workers Compensation Act 1987, schedule 2 part 5 Payroll Tax Act 2007 and section 127 of the Industrial Relation Act 1996. If this form is completed in accordance with these provisions, a principal contractor is relieved of liability for workers compensation premiums, payroll tax and remuneration payable by the subcontractor.  A principal contractor can be generally defined to include any person who has entered into a contract for the carrying out of work by another person (or other legal entity called the subcontractor) and where employees of the subcontractor are engaged in carrying out the work which is in connection with the principal contractor’s business.  2.  For the purpose of this Subcontractor’s Statement, a principal contractor is a person (or other legal entity), who has entered into a contract with another person (or other legal entity) referred to as the subcontractor, and employees/workers of that subcontractor will perform the work under contract. The work must be connected to the business undertaking of the principal contractor.  3.  Provide the unique contract number, title, or other information that identifies the contract.  4.  In order to meet the requirements of s127 Industrial Relations Act 1996, a statement in relation to remuneration must state the period to which the statement relates. For sequential Statements ensure that the dates provide continuous coverage.  Section 127(6) of the Industrial Relations Act 1996 defines remuneration ‘as remuneration or other amounts payable to relevant employees by legislation, or under an industrial instrument, in connection with work done by the employees.’  Section 127(11) of the Industrial Relations Act 1996 states ‘to avoid doubt, this section extends to a principal contractor who is the owner or occupier of a building for the carrying out of work in connection with the building so long as the building is owned or occupied by the principal contractor in connection with a business undertaking of the principal contractor.’  5.  Provide the date of the most recent payment claim.  6.  For Workers Compensation purposes an exempt employer is an employer who pays less than $7500 annually, who does not employ an apprentice or trainee and is not a member of a group.  7.  In completing the Subcontractor’s Statement, a subcontractor declares that workers compensation insurance premiums payable up to and including the date(s) on the Statement have been paid, and all premiums owing during the term of the contract will be paid.  8.  In completing the Subcontractor’s Statement, a subcontractor declares that all remuneration payable to relevant employees for work under the contract has been paid.  9.  In completing the Subcontractor’s Statement, a subcontractor declares that all payroll tax payable relating to the work undertaken has been paid.  10.  It is important to note that a business could be both a subcontractor and a principal contractor, if a business ‘in turn’ engages subcontractors to carry out the work. If your business engages a subcontractor you are to also obtain Subcontractor’s Statements from your subcontractors.  Statement Retention  The principal contractor receiving a Subcontractor’s Statement must keep a copy of the Statement for the periods stated in the respective legislation. This is currently up to seven years. ",Annexures
"Offences in respect of a false Statement  In terms of s127(8) of the Industrial Relations Act 1996, a person who gives the principal contractor a written statement knoWing it to be false is guilty of an offence if:  (a)  the person is the subcontractor;  (b)  the person is authorised by the subcontractor to give the statement on behalf of the subcontractor; or  (c} the person holds out or represents that the person is authorised by the subcontractor to give the statement on behalf of the subcontractor.  In terms of s175B of the Workers Compensation Act and clause 18 of schedule 2 of the Payroll Tax Act 2007 a person who gives the principal contractor a written statement knowing it to be false is guilty of an offence.

"Notes  2.  This form is prepared for the purpose of section 175B of the Workers Compensation Act 1987 (NSW), Schedule 2 Part 5 Payroll Tax Act 2007 (NSW) and section 127 of the Industrial Relation Act 1996 (NSW). If this form is completed in accordance with these provisions, a principal contractor is relieved of liability for workers compensation premiums, payroll tax and remuneration payable by the subcontractor.  3.  A principal contractor can be generally defined to include any person who has entered into a contract for the carrying out of work by another person (or other legal entity called the subcontractor) and where employees of the subcontractor are engaged in carrying out the work which is in connection with the principal contractor’s business.  4.  For the purpose of the Subcontractor’s Statement, a principal contractor is a person (or other legal entity), who has entered into a contract with another person (or other legal entity) referred to as the subcontractor, and employees/workers of that subcontractor will perform the work under contract.  The work must be connected to the business undertaking of the principal contractor.  5.  Provide the unique contract number, title, or other information that identifies the contract.  6.  In order to meet the requirements of s127 Industrial Relations Act 1996 (NSW), a statement in relation to remuneration must state the period to which the statement relates.  For sequential Statements ensure that the dates provide continuous coverage.  7.  Section 127(6) of the Industrial Relations Act 1996 (NSW) defines remuneration ‘as remuneration or other amounts payable to relevant employees by legislation, or under an industrial instrument, in connection with work done by the employees. ’  8.  Section 127(11) of the Industrial Relations Act 1996 (NSW) states ‘to avoid doubt, this section extends to a principal contractor who is the owner or occupier of a building for the carrying out of work in connection with the building so long as the building is owned or occupied by the principal contractor in connection with a business undertaking of the principal contractor.’  9.  Provide the date of the most recent payment claim.  10.  For Workers Compensation purposes an exempt employer is an employer who pays less than $7500 annually, who does not employ an apprentice or trainee and is not a member of a group.  11.

In completing the Subcontractor’s Statement, a subcontractor declares that all remuneration payable to relevant employees for work under the contract has been paid.  13.  In completing the Subcontractor’s Statement, a subcontractor declares that all payroll tax payable relating to the work undertaken has been paid.  14.  It is important to note that a business could be both a subcontractor and a principal contractor, if a business ‘in turn’ engages subcontractors to carry out the work.  If your business engages a subcontractor you are to also obtain Subcontractor’s Statements from your subcontractors.  Statement Retention  The principal contractor receiving a Subcontractor’s Statement must keep a copy of the Statement for the periods stated in the respective legislation.  This is currently up to seven years. ",Schedules

TIME FOR COMPLETION  The Contractor must execute the Works to Practical Completion within the time stated on the tender form or within any extended time agreed in writing by the Superintendent. The Contractor is not entitled to an extension of time for delays caused by it at any time, nor for delays due to inclement weather or industrial ",Terms of Contract
"conditions occurring after the time for Practical Completion. The Superintendent may extend the time for completion for any reason.  11. DEFECTS LIABILITY PERIOD  The Contractor must promptly rectify all defects and omissions notified to the Contractor during the period of six months from Practical Completion.

Payment will be made within 15 business days of receipt of the claim. Payment is not evidence of the value of work done or that it has been done satisfactorily or an admission of liability but is payment on account only. Nothing in the Contract will oblige the Principal to pay for work that is not in accordance with the Contract, or for plant or materials not incorporated in the Works on site. For the purposes of the Building Industry Fairness (Security of Payment) Act 2017 (Qld), the Superintendent is authorised to receive payment claims and to issue payment schedules on behalf of the Principal.  14. DEFAULT  14.1  Subject to clause 14.3, if the Contractor fails to commence the work under the Contract within the time stated for commencement in the tender, or fails to proceed with the work at a reasonable rate of progress, or commits any substantial breach of the Contract, the Principal may, by written notice, require the Contractor to show cause by the date specified in the notice why the Principal should not exercise a right under clause 14.2.  14.2  If the Contractor fails to show reasonable cause by the date specified by the Principal, then the Principal will have the power upon notice in writing to the Contractor to terminate the Contract or suspend payment and take the work remaining to be completed wholly or partly out of the hands of the Contractor without prejudice to any rights of the Principal under the Contract or at common law.  14.3  If the Contractor:  (a)  fails to hold a current licence required to perform the work under the Contract; or  (b)  becomes insolvent or bankrupt, or being a company goes into liquidation, or takes or has instituted against it any action or proceedings which has as an object or may result in bankruptcy or liquidation; or  (c)  enters into a debt agreement, a deed of assignment or a deed of arrangement under the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth), or, being a company, enters into a deed of company arrangement with its creditors, or an administrator or controller is appointed; or  (d)  has a receiver or a receiver and manager appointed or a mortgagee goes into possession of any of its assets, ",Terms of Contract
"the Principal may, without giving a notice to show cause, exercise a right under clause 14 (b), but only when and to the extent that there is no restriction on enforcing that right under the Part 5.1, Part 5.2, or Division 17 of Part 5.3A Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).  14.4  In the event that the Principal takes the work out of the hands of the Contractor, the Principal may itself or by means of other persons, complete the whole or any part of that work and may without payment of compensation take possession of the constructional plant and other things on or in the vicinity of the site as are owned by the Contractor. If the cost incurred by the Principal in completing the work is greater than the amount which would have been paid to the Contractor if the Contractor had completed the work, the difference will be a debt due from the Contractor to the Principal, otherwise any difference will be a debt due from the Principal to the Contractor.  15. DISPUTES  Within 10 business days of a dispute arising either party may refer it to the Superintendent. Within 20 business days of receiving notice of dispute the Superintendent will give its written decision. If the Superintendent fails to give the decision, or if either party is dissatisfied with it, the parties must within 10 business days of receipt of the decision, or the date upon which it should have been given, confer to resolve the dispute.  16.

"PREFACE  This Standard was prepared by the Joint Standards Australia/Standards New Zealand Committee OB/3, General Conditions of Contract.  This Standard incorporates Amendment No. 1 (March 2005). The changes required by the Amendment are indicated in the text by a marginal bar and amendment number against the clause, note, table, figure or part thereof affected.  This Standard is the result of a consensus among Australian and New Zealand representatives on the Joint Committee to produce it as an Australian Standard.  AS 4902—2000 General conditions of contract for design and construct, is a part of the suite of conditions of contract based on AS 4000—1997 General conditions of contract.  This Standard covers the following types of project procurement methods:  (a)  design and construct;  (b)  design development and construct; and  (c)  design, novate and construct.  If the project procurement method chosen by the Principal is:  (a)  design and construct—the Principal would provide the Principal’s project requirements, would not normally provide a detailed preliminary design and would not require novation;  (b)  design development and construct—the Principal would provide the Principal’s project requirements, would always provide a preliminary design and accordingly would complete Annexure Part A Items 10 and 11;  (c)  design, novate and construct—the Principal would provide the Principal’s project requirements, would always provide a preliminary design, would complete Annexure Part A Items 10 and 11 and would complete Annexure Part A Item 20 stating which subcontract (including consultant’s agreement) or selected subcontract is to be novated to the Contractor.  Subclauses 8.6 and 29.2, prefixed by *, are optional, and may be omitted in the Contract, where necessary, without making consequential amendments but such omission should be clearly shown on the face of the document by striking out these subclauses or indicating clearly in clause 1 of Annexure Part E or elsewhere that they are not to apply. See paragraph (i) of clause 1 for the effect of stating deletions in Annexure Part E.  WARNINGS  (1)  Users of this Australian Standard are warned that clause 15 (Damage to persons and property other than WUC) does not limit the liability of parties for special, indirect or consequential losses.  This unlimited liability applies notwithstanding any limitations or exclusions permitted under insurance clauses 16A (Insurance of the Works), 16B (Professional indemnity insurance) and 17 (Public liability insurance).  Parties wishing to limit their liability should seek insurance and legal advice before entering a contract under this Standard.  (2)  Principals should ensure that their specific requirements are fully and completely incorporated in the Principal’s project requirements obtaining specialist advice if necessary. Where a Contractor provides a proposed design as part of its tender, the parties should consider whether that design should form part of the preliminary design. ",No Section
"(3)  The risk allocation, drafting, interpretation and construction of this Standard are interrelated. Users who alter the Standard do so at their own risk and should obtain specialist advice as to whether it is suitable for a particular project.  (4)  Contractors should ensure that they satisfy the requirements of payment for unfixed plant and materials.  (5)  Legislation has come into force in some jurisdictions dealing with security of payments. Parties intending to use this Standard should seek expert advice as to their rights and obligations under such legislation. ",No Section
